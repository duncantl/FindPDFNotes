Title: Find pages in PDF documents with Hand-written Notes
Description: Annotating notes on a PDF document on  tablet is convenient.
 For large documents, it is covenient to be able to jump straight to the
 pages with those hand-written notes rather than having to scroll through
 the pages, possibly missing small marks such as deletions.
 This very small collection of functions is  a personal utility for finding
 these pages.
 It tells us how many pages have annotations.  It also displays each page  using the default PDF viewer.
 Currently, this is just for OSX. One can define methods for Linux and Windows.
 This uses a modified version of pdftohtml to create an XML description of the
 PDF.  We then look for <coords> nodes.
 This can identify false-positives  where a <coords> node is actually part of
 the original document, e.g., in a figure, plot, etc.
