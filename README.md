Some of us edit/annotate PDF documents on a tablet rather than our laptop/desktop so that we can use
hand-written notes.  While it would be great to have these available as formal, recognized text,
simply knowing on which pages we have notes would be useful.  When we have lengthy documents and
annotations on relatively few pages, we don't want to have to search for notes.  This very
simple-minded package identifies those pages for us and also
displays them so we can page through the notes and transfer them to other files.
